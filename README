vootstrap is a python virtualenv bootstrap creator.  Its command-line arguments
are identical to virtualenv with a few notable additions:

- Instead of a directory to install the virtual environment into, give an
  output filename.  When the resulting file is executed it will create the
  virtual environment in the directory where it resides with the same
  parameters provided to vootstrap.

- The --path argument can be used 0 or more times to add additional directories
  to the virtual environment's sys.path.  These directories should be given
  relative to the location of the output vootstrap file in most all cases.

- The --install-requirements flag can be set to automatically pip install the
  requirements.txt file inside the virtual environment after it is built.


Usage: vootstrap [OPTIONS] OUTFILE

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         Increase verbosity
  -q, --quiet           Decrease verbosity
  -p PYTHON_EXE, --python=PYTHON_EXE
                        The Python interpreter to use, e.g.,
                        --python=python2.5 will use the python2.5 interpreter
                        to create the new environment.  The default is the
                        interpreter that virtualenv was installed with
                        (/usr/bin/python)
  --clear               Clear out the non-root install and start from scratch
  --no-site-packages    Don't give access to the global site-packages dir to
                        the virtual environment (default; deprecated)
  --system-site-packages
                        Give access to the global site-packages dir to the
                        virtual environment
  --unzip-setuptools    Unzip Setuptools or Distribute when installing it
  --relocatable         Make an EXISTING virtualenv environment relocatable.
                        This fixes up scripts and makes all .pth files
                        relative
  --distribute, --use-distribute
                        Use Distribute instead of Setuptools. Set environ
                        variable VIRTUALENV_DISTRIBUTE to make it the default
  --extra-search-dir=SEARCH_DIRS
                        Directory to look for setuptools/distribute/pip
                        distributions in. You can add any number of additional
                        --extra-search-dir paths.
  --never-download      Never download anything from the network.  Instead,
                        virtualenv will fail if local distributions of
                        setuptools/distribute/pip are not present.
  --prompt=PROMPT       Provides an alternative prompt prefix for this
                        environment
  --install-requirements
                        Install requirements.txt after vootstrapping
  --path=PATH           Directory to add to vootstrapped sys.path. You can add
                        any number of additional --path paths. Relative
                        directories are relative to the vootstrapped directory
